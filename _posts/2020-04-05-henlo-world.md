I'm putting together this bare-bones blog so that I have a place to put my posts during my time at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) (and perhaps even after that).

I just finished my first week, and everything about it was overwhelming and exhausting in the best possible way. Because of the Coronavirus outbreak, I'm a part of the first fully-remote batch. Coming in, I expected time management to be tricky because I'm in my apartment, where all of the video games and yarn and books are. But instead of getting distracted by things in my apartment, I found myself being excited about more things at RC than I could possibly do in any given day. I wanted to work on my project (more on that soon), meet everyone, attend every discussion, read every Zulip and blog post... and I did a lot of all of that, in addition to some after-hours remote hangouts.

I invested some time this week getting my dev setup nice and comfy, both for myself and for pairing. I like to be able to leave things somewhat messy, and I'm used to working on Linux, so I set up the Raspberry Pi 3 that's been gathering dust for years with Raspbian Lite and tmux and my dotfiles. I love being able to ssh in from anywhere in my apartment with the same session going from the day before, and I don't anticipate bumping up against the tiny 1GB ram / 32GB storage on this thing (famous last words).

I also pushed myself to present on my project and what I'd been learning. Presenting over Zoom was less terrifying than speaking in person, mostly because I couldn't see anyone, but also because everyone I've met so far has been really supportive and lovely.

Outside of project work, some of the highlights of the first week have been everyone else's presentations (technical and non-), Networking Club, Music Consumption Group, and all of the coffee chats (1:1s) I've gotten to have. For the coming week, now that I know what to expect, I'd like to be more deliberate about how I spend my time so that know I can get work done while still taking advantage of all of the rest of RC.

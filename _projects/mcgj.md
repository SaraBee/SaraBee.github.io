Music Consumption Group, or MCG for short, is a music-sharing event that
happens every Tuesday night at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).
Participants have a chance to select one track per round and talk briefly
about their pick. The DJ -- or MCGJ in this case -- coordinates the rounds and
plays the music from their computer.

MCGJ is a web app built using Flask and sqlite that allows participants to
queue up their tracks and helps the DJ manage track order. It also serves as
an archive of past sessions, with the ability to import from or export to
Spotify playlists.

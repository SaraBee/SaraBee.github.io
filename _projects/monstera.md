As an anxious new plant parent, I wanted to make sure I wasn't over- or
under-watering my beautiful *monstera deliciosa* plant. I decided to give my
plant the ability to voice its own needs by way of soil moisture and humidity
sensors and a Twitter API integration.

I wrote about this project in more detail in my Plant Tweets blog posts: [Part
1](/2020/04/19/plant-tweets-part-1/) and [Part 2](Plant Tweets,
Part 2).

On a normal day, my plant checks in with its moisture levels every 12 hours.
If it needs watering or help with humidity, it gets my attention by mentioning
my main Twitter account, which sends me a push notification. Check out my
plant's latest tweets below:

As an anxious new plant parent, I wanted to make sure I wasn't over- or
under-watering my beautiful *monstera deliciosa* plant. I decided to give my
plant the ability to voice its own needs by way of soil moisture and humidity
sensors and a Twitter API integration.

I wrote about this project in more detail in my Plant Tweets blog posts: [Part
1](/2020/04/19/plant-tweets-part-1/) and [Part 2](Plant Tweets,
Part 2).

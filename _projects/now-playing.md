As a daily listener of WQXR, I often find myself wondering about the music I'm
listening to, but am too impatient to wait for the announcer to come on the
air and tell me what it is that I'm listening to. So, I added the information
directly to my tmux status bar so that I don't have to leave my terminal to go
check their website.

As a fun bonus, I also created a simple cli guess-the-composer game using the
same backend.
